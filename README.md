RebarDSC is a new dataset of the industrial rebar collection scene. To construct this dataset:
- We collected 2,125 images from the top 3 rebar manufacturing companies in Asia,where the image are captured in the real production environment with various types of mobile devices, with resolution vary from 800×600 to 4600×3400; 
- To satisfy the requirement of bundle counting, we capture all the raw images with a bundle of rebar as the image center. If two or more bundles are captured, we only considered the rebar within the bundle closing to the image center and ignored other bundles. 
- We hired professional human workers from rebar manufacturing companies to annotate each image’s bounding box, and finally, 350,348 annotations, 164.9 annotations per image are collected.
